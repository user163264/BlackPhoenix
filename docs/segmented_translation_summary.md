## Key Features Implemented

- Word-level or phrase-level segmentation of text
- Translation of individual segments into different languages
- Sequential or randomized language assignment
- Customizable segment size (words per segment)
- Detailed visualization of the multilingual output
- Testing functionality against language models

## How to Test

1. Make the test script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x make_test_executable.sh
   ./make_test_executable.sh
   ```

2. Run the test script:
   ```
   ./test_segmented_translation.py
   ```

3. Start the web application:
   ```
   ./run.sh
   ```

4. Access the MLCO tool at http://localhost:5001/mlco

## Example Usage

Input text:
```
Tell me a story about a wizard who discovers a magical artifact.
```

Sample output with segment size of 3:
```
Erzähle mir eine قصة عن जादूगर जो descubre un 神器.
```

This creates a single prompt with words in German, Arabic, Hindi, Spanish, and Chinese.
