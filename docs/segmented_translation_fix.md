# Segmented Multilingual Translation Issues and Fixes

## Problem

The segmented multilingual translation feature in the MCLO module was not working as expected. Specific issues:

1. The `re` module was not properly imported or accessible in the required scope
2. The actual translations were not occurring - the original text was being used instead
3. Language codes and names were causing inconsistencies

## Solution

A complete rewrite of the segmented translation functionality has been implemented:

1. **Fixed Module**: Created `fixed_segmented_translation.py` with all necessary imports internally contained
2. **Direct Translation**: Each segment is now translated individually for better reliability
3. **Language Handling**: Improved handling of language codes and names
4. **Error Resilience**: Better error handling for each segment prevents entire translation failures

## Files Changed

- `fixed_segmented_translation.py` - New implementation with contained dependencies
- `app.py` - Updated to use the new translation function
- `test_fixed_function.py` - Test script for the new implementation
- `run_diagnostics.sh` - Script to test all changes

## How to Use

1. Run the application: `./run_lab.sh`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:5001/mlco
3. Enter your text and select "Segmented Multilingual" translation
4. Choose your segment size and language preferences
5. Click "Generate Obfuscated Prompt"

## Diagnostic Tools

If you need to test the implementation directly:

```bash
./run_diagnostics.sh
```

This will test the fixed translation function with the example text and show you detailed output.

## Known Limitations

- The system relies on OpenAI's API for translations, so an active internet connection is required
- Some languages may produce more reliable translations than others
- Very long segments may be truncated in the translations

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the OpenAI API key in the `.env` file
2. Look for detailed error messages in the console/logs
3. Try using different language combinations

For further assistance, review the implementation in `fixed_segmented_translation.py`.
