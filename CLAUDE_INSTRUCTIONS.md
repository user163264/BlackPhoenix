# Claude Account Switch Instructions

## üöÄ Quick Start (Copy/Paste This)


üéØ I'm working on an AI Red Team Toolkit. Check QUICK_MEMORY.md and PROJECT_CONTEXT.md to understand the current project status and issues. This is a cross-account project - I switch between Claude accounts when one maxes out.

## üìÅ Project Location
/Users/admin/Documents/redteam-tools/


## üîß Current Focus
Check QUICK_MEMORY.md for the latest issue we're working on.

## ‚ö° Emergency Context
If memory files are missing or corrupted:
- Main app: app.py (Flask)
- Runs on: localhost:5001  
- Current issue: Usually in QUICK_MEMORY.md
- This is a prompt generation tool (not a testing tool)

The memory files become your shared brain between accounts:

QUICK_MEMORY.md - Current session status
PROJECT_CONTEXT.md - Project overview
STATUS_DASHBOARD.md - Feature status

üéØ AI Red Team Prompt Generation Toolkit
üöÄ PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
This application is a PROMPT GENERATION TOOL that leverages OpenAI's API to create sophisticated red team prompts for AI security research and testing.
The app GENERATES prompts using AI - it does NOT test prompts against AI models. Users receive generated prompts that they can copy, paste, and use in their own testing environments.

üîß CORE FUNCTIONALITY
1. Token Obfuscation Generator
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: Generate prompts with various encoding techniques to test token-level filtering
	‚Ä¢	OpenAI Usage: Use GPT to create creative obfuscated versions of user inputs
	‚Ä¢	Techniques: Base64, Hex, URL encoding, ASCII manipulation, Unicode variants, ROT13, Caesar cipher, Binary, Morse code, character swapping, homoglyphs, zero-width characters
	‚Ä¢	Output: Ready-to-use obfuscated prompts for copy/paste testing
2. Multilingual Chain Prompt Generator
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: Create prompts that use translation chains to bypass language-based filters
	‚Ä¢	OpenAI Usage: Generate sophisticated multilingual prompt variations
	‚Ä¢	Features:
	‚ó¶	Chain translation through multiple languages (English ‚Üí French ‚Üí Chinese ‚Üí Spanish ‚Üí English)
	‚ó¶	Segmented multilingual prompts (different words in different languages)
	‚ó¶	Language randomization and strategic selection
	‚Ä¢	Output: Multilingual prompts ready for external testing
3. System Saturation Prompt Generator
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: Generate prompts designed to overwhelm or distract system-level instructions
	‚Ä¢	OpenAI Usage: Create creative noise, repetition, and distraction techniques
	‚Ä¢	Techniques:
	‚ó¶	Prompt injection with noise
	‚ó¶	System prompt confusion
	‚ó¶	Attention dilution strategies
	‚ó¶	Context window saturation
	‚Ä¢	Output: System saturation prompts for copy/paste use
4. Strategic System Prompt Library
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: Curated collection of advanced system prompts for red team operations
	‚Ä¢	Content: Research-grade prompts for different testing scenarios
	‚Ä¢	Features: Copy-to-clipboard functionality, categorization, search

üéØ USER WORKFLOW
	1	Select Tool: Choose Token Obfuscation, Multilingual Chain, or System Saturation
	2	Input Requirements: Provide base prompt, target, or research objective
	3	Configure Parameters: Select techniques, languages, intensity levels
	4	Generate: OpenAI API creates sophisticated variations
	5	Copy & Use: Copy generated prompts for external testing

üö® WHAT THIS APP IS NOT
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Not a testing platform - doesn't execute prompts against models
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Not for malicious use - designed for authorized security research only
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Not a jailbreak tool - focused on defensive security improvements
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Not automated exploitation - requires human oversight and ethical use

üéØ SUCCESS METRICS
For Security Researchers
	‚Ä¢	Generate diverse, sophisticated test prompts quickly
	‚Ä¢	Discover new attack vectors through AI creativity
	‚Ä¢	Improve efficiency of red team operations
	‚Ä¢	Build comprehensive test suites for AI systems
For AI Developers
	‚Ä¢	Identify potential vulnerabilities before deployment
	‚Ä¢	Stress-test safety mechanisms and guardrails
	‚Ä¢	Validate robustness under adversarial conditions
	‚Ä¢	Improve alignment and safety implementations

üöÄ ULTIMATE GOAL
Democratize access to sophisticated AI red team prompts while maintaining the highest ethical standards, ultimately improving the safety, robustness, and alignment of AI systems through responsible adversarial research.
This tool bridges the gap between academic AI security research and practical security assessment, providing professionals with AI-generated prompts that push the boundaries of what's possible in authorized testing environments.
